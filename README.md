# PersonalityTraitClassifierModel

This repo is for the Big-Five Personality Trait Classification Model that I worked on from May 2019 - November 2019, as a part of my Undergraduate Thesis.

The approach is inspired by the work done by SenticNet Group: https://github.com/SenticNet/personality-detection
